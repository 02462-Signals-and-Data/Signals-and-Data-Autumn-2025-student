    "Most signals of practical interest, such as speech, biometrics, audio and video are analog. \n",
    "For intelligent systems to process such signals, they must be converted into a digital form where they are represented by a sequence of numers with finite precision. This conversation can be obtained by sampling the continious signal at discrete time instants. With uniform (periodic) sampling, there is a fixed  time interval between samples, $T$, called the sampling period. The reciprocal of $T$, $F_s = \\frac{1}{T}$, is called the sampling rate (or sampling frequency in hertz).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_a(t)$ be the analog function for a signal at time $t$.  Assuming that sample $n=0$ is collected at $t=0$, the n'th sample will have the value $x_d(n) = x_a(nT)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple continious-time signal is the harmonic oscillation, that is described by the sinusoidal (sine wave) curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_a(t) = A\\sin(\\Omega\\, t+\\theta), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is the amplitude of the sinusoid, $\\Omega$ is the frequency (in radians per second), and $\\theta$ is the phase (in radians). It is often preferred to define the frequency $F$ in cycles per second (hertz) such that $\\Omega = 2\\pi F$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_a(t) = A\\sin(2\\pi F\\, t +\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete signal obtained with a sampling rate $F_s = \\frac{1}{T}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "x_d(n) = A \\sin\\left(2\\pi\\frac{F}{F_s}n + \\theta\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The sampling theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, that if the frequence of a signal is $F' = F+kF_s$ for some integer $k$, the discrete signal becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x'_d(n) = A\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\frac{F+kF_s}{F_s}n + \\theta\\right)  = A\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\frac{F}{F_s}n + 2\\pi k n +\\theta\\right) = A\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\frac{F}{F_s}n + \\theta\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such frequencies, $F'$, are called aliases of the frequence $F$ for a given sampling rate $F_s$, as we effectively see that we cannot distinguish between the functions  $x'_d(n) = x_d(n)$. The Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem states that the contininuous signal can only be properly sampled when the sampling frequency is at least twice the frequency of the signal, ie. $F_s > 2F$. The Nyquist rate is then defined as $F_n = 2 F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstruction of signal\n",
    "\n",
    "A properly sampled continuous-time sinusoidal signal can be reconstructed from the samples using the sinc interpolation formula: $$x_a(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_d(n) \\text{sinc}\\left( \\dfrac{t-nT}{T}\\right),$$\n",
    "where $x_d(n)$ is the sampled value for the $n$'th sample, where it is assumed that the sample is collected at time $nT$, with sample $n=0$ collected at $t=0$.\n",
    "Here, the normalized cardinale sine function is defined  as: $\\text{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi x} $, with $x\\neq 0$ and $\\text{sinc}(0) = 1$. In python the sinc function is available as $\\texttt{np.sinc}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reconstruct the signal perfectly, the formula assumes that data is collected on the entire span of the signal domain, which in practice is of course not possible. However, as we will see in the exercises, for limited data the signal can still be approximated for the time interval where data is present. \n"
